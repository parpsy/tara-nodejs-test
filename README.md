# refactionjs
Refactoring exercise for Node

## Getting started for applicants

Fork this repository to clean up the code and put it in a sensible structure, using the best of idiomatic ES and modern libraries/frameworks possible. The application runs correctly, but there's some duplication and tangling of concerns.

To run:
```
npm install
npm start
```

Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Important - the requirements

* The code must be able to be built and run with npm commands - no extra scripts or tools that can't be run from what's in `package.json`
* You should not use any other library or frameworks.

## Guidance

There is no "right answer", but some good things to do might be:
* Separate concerns: untangle business logic, structure and data access
* Use ES6+ features to improve the readability, scoping, reuse of the code
* Improve the configurability by replacing hardcoded values with appropriate mechanisms for specifying them
* Introduce a linter
* Improve error handling
* Add logging
* Use common design patterns

## Additional point
* Creating a clean git history base on `conventional commits` specification
